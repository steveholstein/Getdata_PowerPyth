You gave me the following response and code. Can amend to write tehj text to Excel as well as word

Your response:
It's clear that the process you're following involves a combination of using Selenium with manual intervention to copy text, which is not the most efficient way to achieve your goal. Instead, automating the extraction of the financial data from Yahoo Finance directly through scraping would provide a much faster and more reliable solution. 

Below is a revised version of your code that automates the entire process, eliminating the need for manual text copying. This version extracts the financial data directly from the Yahoo Finance webpage and saves it to a Word document.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from docx import Document
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# Initialize Chrome with options, if needed
options = Options()
# options.add_argument('--headless')  # Uncomment for headless mode

# Initialize the driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# Navigate to the Yahoo Finance IBM financials page
driver.get("https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/financials")

# Allow some time for the page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Extract the financial data
financial_data = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "body").text

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

# Create a new Word document and add the extracted text
doc = Document()
doc.add_paragraph(financial_data)
doc.save('financial_data.docx')

print("Text has been copied and saved to 'financial_data.docx'")
```

### Summary of Changes
1. **Removed the manual copy step:** The script now automatically extracts the financial data from the Yahoo Finance webpage.
2. **Extracts text directly from the webpage:** Using `driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "body").text` to get the text content of the entire page.
3. **No more waiting time:** Eliminates the need for the `time.sleep(7)` pause since there's no manual copying.
4. **Automates text addition to Word doc:** The extracted text is directly added to the Word document without needing to interact with the clipboard.

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install selenium python-docx
```

Using this improved approach, the entire process should be faster and more efficient without the need for manual intervention.
