the code you gave me takes a very long time to run

Time: Thu May 30 18:48:33 2024
Text has been copied and saved to 'copied_text.docx'
Time: Thu May 30 18:49:03 2024


Code:
Certainly! Below is the modified version of your code. It includes a 7-second pause to allow you to manually highlight and copy the desired text. After 7 seconds, it will paste the text from the clipboard into a Word document.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from docx import Document
import pyperclip
import time

# Initialize Chrome with options, if needed
options = Options()
# options.add_argument('--headless')  # Uncomment for headless mode

# Initialize the driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# Navigate to the Yahoo Finance IBM financials page
driver.get("https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/financials")

# Allow some time for the page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Wait for 7 seconds to allow user to highlight and copy text
time.sleep(7)

# Retrieve the text from the clipboard
copied_text = pyperclip.paste()

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

# Create a new Word document and add the copied text
doc = Document()
doc.add_paragraph(copied_text)
doc.save('copied_text.docx')

print("Text has been copied and saved to 'copied_text.docx'")
```

### Summary of Changes
1. **Removed the JavaScript alert:** There's no prompt asking you to press "OK" anymore.
2. **Added a 7-second pause:** The code now uses `time.sleep(7)` to give you time to manually highlight and copy the text.
3. **Removed the part that copies text via the script:** Since you wanted to manually copy the text, the automatic text copy portion has been removed.
4. **Pastes the text from the clipboard:**
   - It retrieves the text from the clipboard using `pyperclip.paste()`.
   - It then saves the text into a Word document.

This modification should meet your requirements without interrupting your flow for manually copying the text.
