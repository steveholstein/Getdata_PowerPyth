Firstly, the filename `query_file2` is not defined; you likely meant to use `query_file` instead. Secondly, make sure that the string manipulation and file reading operations are correctly called. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```python
# Define the filename for the query text
query_file = "queries.txt"

# Open the query file in read mode ("r")
with open(query_file, "r") as file:  # Use 'file' instead of 'query_file' to avoid naming conflict
    # Read the entire query text or specific lines (adjust as needed)
    query_text = file.read().strip()  # Read entire file and strip whitespace
```

Note the following corrections:
1. `query_file2` was corrected to `query_file` in the `with open` statement.
2. The variable name in the `with open` statement was changed to `file` to avoid shadowing the `query_file` variable.

This cleaned-up code should work as intended, reading the contents of `queries.txt` and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
